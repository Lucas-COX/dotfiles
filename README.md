# dotfiles
Here are my i3 / zsh / vim configuration files. 

## :file_folder: Needs
To fully use the zsh and vim configuration files, you will need the following
packages :
```shell
bat
exa
fzf
vim-plug
```

## :warning: Warns
You may have to manually run the following command in vim or neovim for
installing the markdown-preview package :
```vim
:call mkdp#util#install()
```

## :loudspeaker: Shoutout
Most of the i3 files are or are based on the [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) configuration files.\
Make sure to check their work if it's not already done, it is one of the best
linux distros I've tried.
